# Velvet Control - Reloaded II Audience interactivity Mod for P5RPC
Velvet Control is a P5RPC mod which uses Twitch's PubSub and Helix APIs to allow Twitch audiences to trigger effects during a streamer's playthrough of Persona 5 Royal. 
This mod has only been tested with the Steam release of P5.

## This mod is a WIP
You can follow its progress here, as well as on the repo and twitch extension mods this will depend on:
- [Velvet Control Server](https://github.com/dotBeeps/velvet-control-server) - backend service for Velvet Control.
- Velvet Control Extension - Velvet Control Twitch panel extension.
